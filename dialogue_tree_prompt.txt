Conversation summary : {In the bustling arcade of the spirit concourse, a timid spirit named Luna approaches the player, her glow dimmed with worry. She shyly greets the manager, her voice quavering as she inquires about the recent failure of the claw machineâ€”a favorite haunt for spirits like her. Despite her nervousness, she expresses her disappointment, sharing a heartfelt story of the joy it brought her during her time in the living world. As the player listens attentively, Luna's sincerity shines through, revealing her longing for connection and fun. She apologizes for being a bit too forward but seeks help with a kind request: could the player perhaps fix the machine? With a humble thanks, she appreciates the player's efforts, expressing genuine gratitude for their support, even as the conversation grows heavier with an air of sadness and respect when it turns toward the inevitable farewells in the afterlife. As Luna's glow begins to fade, she bids a polite goodbye, a bittersweet reminder of the spirits' transient nature, leaving the player with a sense of accomplishment but also longing for the joy they strive to bring their charges.}
